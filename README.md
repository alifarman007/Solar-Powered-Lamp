<h2>Description</h2>
In the ISHO Innovation Lab, I developed a solar-powered lamp, which contained within itself a solar panel and all related circuitry. After being exposed to the sun during the day, the lamp was able to supply light for several hours at the push of a switch. ISHO was providing a village that was disconnected from the main power grid, with several of these lamps. This was hoped to bring light to homes that needed it and provide a catalyst for progress in the business and lifestyle of these communities.
